# CarRental Application

This project was developed as part of a university course on Programming Language in 2021. It is a simple console-based Car Rental Application written in C. It allows users to manage customer information, vehicle inventory, and rental transactions.

**Features:**

Customer Management: Add new customers and search for existing customers by ID, name, or phone number.
Vehicle Management: Add new vehicles, delete vehicles, and search for vehicles by various criteria such as model year, make, model name, and license plate number.
Rental Transactions: Rent a vehicle to a customer and receive rented vehicles back from customers.

**Note:**

This application uses text files (Customer.txt and vehicle.txt) to store customer and vehicle information respectively. Make sure these files are present in the same directory as the compiled executable.

This is a basic implementation intended for educational purposes. Feel free to modify and enhance it as needed.
